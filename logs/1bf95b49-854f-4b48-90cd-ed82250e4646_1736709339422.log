[2025-01-13 01:16:18] ASSISTANT: Islam provides guidance and support for those who are feeling overwhelmed or in distress. Here are some key points from Islamic teachings:

1. **Seek Help through Prayer and Patience**: The Quran encourages believers to seek help through patience and prayer. Allah says in the Quran: 
   > "O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient." (Quran 2:153)

2. **Trust in Allah's Plan**: Muslims believe that Allah has a plan for everyone, and trusting in His wisdom can provide comfort. The Quran states:
   > "And whoever relies upon Allah â€“ then He is sufficient for him." (Quran 65:3)

3. **Talk to Someone You Trust**: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of community and support. Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend or family member can be beneficial.

4. **Remember Allah's Mercy**: Allah is described as the Most Merciful. Turning to Him in times of hardship can be a source of comfort and strength.

5. **Seek Professional Help**: Islam does not oppose seeking help from mental health professionals. Taking care of one's mental health is important and can be seen as part of taking care of the body, which is a trust from Allah.

6. **Make Du'a (Supplication)**: Turning to Allah in supplication is encouraged. There are specific supplications for ease and relief that can be recited.

If you or someone you know is going through a tough time, it's crucial to reach out to a mental health professional for support.
