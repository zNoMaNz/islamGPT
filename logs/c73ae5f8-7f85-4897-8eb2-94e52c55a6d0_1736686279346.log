[2025-01-12 18:51:51] USER: Is it haram to date a friend?
[2025-01-12 18:51:55] ASSISTANT: In Islam, the concept of dating as understood in a modern, Western context is generally not permissible. This is because it often involves forming emotional and physical relationships outside the boundaries of marriage, which can lead to actions that are considered haram (forbidden) in Islam, such as premarital intimacy.

Islam encourages relationships to be conducted within the framework of marriage, which is seen as a sacred and legally binding contract that offers protection and rights to both parties. The Quran states:

"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." (Quran 17:32)

However, Islam does allow for individuals to get to know each other in a respectful and supervised manner with the intention of marriage. This can involve family involvement or meeting in a group setting to ensure that interactions remain appropriate.

If you have a friend whom you are interested in, it is recommended to approach the situation with the intention of marriage and to involve family or guardians to ensure that interactions are conducted in a halal (permissible) manner.
