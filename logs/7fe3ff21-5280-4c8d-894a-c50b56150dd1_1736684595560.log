[2025-01-12 19:46:05] USER: Let's say I've lived in Dhaka, Bangladesh for a few decades. However, I occasionally visit my permanent address, which is my home district, father's place where I was initially born. Is it okay to pray qasr salah there instead of the whole farz rakats?
[2025-01-12 19:46:10] ASSISTANT: In Islamic jurisprudence, the rules for performing Qasr Salah (shortened prayer) apply when a person is traveling. The general principle is that if you travel a distance of approximately 48 miles (77 kilometers) or more from your city of residence, you are eligible to perform Qasr Salah. 

However, the situation becomes slightly different when you are visiting your home district or the place of your original residence. If you intend to stay there for less than 15 days, you can perform Qasr Salah because you are considered a traveler. But if you plan to stay for 15 days or more and you have the intention to settle temporarily during this period, you should perform the full Salah, as you would no longer be considered a traveler according to most scholars.

In your case, if your visits to your home district are short (less than 15 days), you can perform Qasr Salah. If they are longer, you should perform the full Salah.

For further clarity, it's always good to refer to a knowledgeable local scholar or imam who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances.
