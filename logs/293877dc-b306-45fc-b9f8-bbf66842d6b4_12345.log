[2025-01-13 01:13:10] ASSISTANT: Islam is a monotheistic religion founded on the belief in one God, Allah, and is based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who is considered the final prophet in a long line of prophets. The word "Islam" itself means "submission" or "surrender," reflecting the core idea of submitting to the will of Allah.

The primary sources of Islamic teachings are the Quran, which is believed to be the literal word of God as revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the Hadith, which are the recorded sayings and actions of the Prophet. 

The core beliefs of Islam are encapsulated in the Five Pillars:

1. **Shahada (Faith):** Declaring there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.
2. **Salah (Prayer):** Performing the five daily prayers.
3. **Zakat (Almsgiving):** Giving to charity and aiding those in need.
4. **Sawm (Fasting):** Observing fast during the month of Ramadan.
5. **Hajj (Pilgrimage):** Performing the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime, if physically and financially able.

Islam also emphasizes values such as justice, compassion, and community welfare, and encourages followers to lead a life of righteousness, guided by the principles outlined in the Quran and Sunnah (the practices of the Prophet).
