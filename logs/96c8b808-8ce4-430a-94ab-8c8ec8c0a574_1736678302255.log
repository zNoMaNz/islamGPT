[2025-01-12 16:47:00] ASSISTANT: Sure! Did you know that in Islam, the concept of mercy is one of the most emphasized attributes of Allah? The Quran begins with the phrase "Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim," which means "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful." This phrase is repeated at the beginning of 113 out of the 114 chapters of the Quran, highlighting the importance of mercy and compassion in Islam. Mercy is also a key aspect of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) character, who is described as a "mercy to the worlds" (Quran 21:107).
